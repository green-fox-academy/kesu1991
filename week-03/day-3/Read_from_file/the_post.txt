The Post

        Katharine Graham is the first female publisher of a major American newspaper
        -- The Washington Post. With help from editor Ben Bradlee, Graham races to
        catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government 
        secrets that spans three decades and four U.S. presidents. Together, 
        they must overcome their differences as they risk their careers -- 
        and very freedom -- to help bring long-buried truths to light.
